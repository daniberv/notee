Notee is a notes taking app in aestetic typewriting manner. I love writing longread and some massive reading content. So I create this application that fits all my needs:

## Basic

- all typical stuff: plain text, paragraphs, multilevel headers, highlights, italic, bold
- images
- videos
- lists
- links
- article cover

## Features or why it exists

All articles, stories, notes I write are about to be published. So I needed some app that can be used for drafting. Tons of MacOS/Windows note taking applications I tried 
Every note can contain a cover so it looks amazing. But the best part is about content storage. Once your article is ready you want to publish it. It can be some website or blogging platform. There is no problem with the text content.. you typically just copy and paste it. So the problem is how to manage all article's media stuff such as cover, images and videos? That's annoying part. And that's where Notee come into play. All media content you use are being stored in it's folder. It can be accessed just by 1 click "Folder" button. This is a main idea

## Dev disclaimer

This is just a tool I create for myself first. It's being coded fast and it is not a commercial product. That means you shouldn't use the code or its parts that you can find here. It breaks lots or rules and go against best practices. I'll refactor it one day... may be.
